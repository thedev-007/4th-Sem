1. Reflection of Ultrasound is the **bouncing back** of Sound wave from the surface of Solid/Liquid.
2. Reflection of Ultrasound also follows the law of **Reflection of Light**. (Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection.)
3. This means that the Angle of ***Incidence*** wave & ***Reflected*** Wave to the Normal are **Equal**.
